# Business Understanding
Airbnb is a popular platform for both hosts and travelers. The platform simplifies the process of listing, searching, and booking accommodations. Hosts can easily list their properties, set their prices, and manage bookings, while travelers can effortlessly search for and compare various lodging options. Additionally, Airbnb's review system, which allows both hosts and guests to rate and review each other, plays a crucial role in building trust and ensuring the quality of experiences. This peer-to-peer review system has been fundamental in promoting a sense of community and reliability, crucial in the sharing economy.

# Unlocking Insights: A Deep Dive into Data Analysis

1)How does the availability of properties on Airbnb vary by month in a single year?  
[Question_1.ipynb](https://github.com/RaghuVaranKula/seattle_airbnb_analysis/blob/main/Question_1.ipynb)   
2)If availability is treated as occupancy, what would be the revenue for each month in that year?    
[Question_2.ipynb](https://github.com/RaghuVaranKula/seattle_airbnb_analysis/blob/main/Question_2.ipynb)   
3)How does the rent price per day vary for different properties?    
[Question_3.ipynb](https://github.com/RaghuVaranKula/seattle_airbnb_analysis/blob/main/Question_3.ipynb)   
4)What is the relationship between property types and rent price per day for those willing to spend up to $100?   
[Question_4.ipynb](https://github.com/RaghuVaranKula/seattle_airbnb_analysis/blob/main/Question_4.ipynb)   
5)Can a model be developed to predict property prices using data from the 'listings.csv' file, and what factors influence the price?    
[Question_5.ipynb](https://github.com/RaghuVaranKula/seattle_airbnb_analysis/blob/main/Question_5.ipynb)  
6)Which are the top 15 listings on Airbnb with the most reviews?    
[Question_6.ipynb](https://github.com/RaghuVaranKula/seattle_airbnb_analysis/blob/main/Question_6.ipynb)

5) Price Prediction Model:  
Build a predictive model for property prices using data from 'listings.csv' and identify influential factors.


6) Top 15 Listings:  
Identify and present the top 15 Airbnb listings with the most reviews.


7) Guest Satisfaction Analysis:  
Provide insights into overall guest satisfaction and listing performance using mean, median, and standard deviation metrics.


# Installation
Our analysis will involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization. Python and relevant libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn) will be used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

# Results
The findings and results for each question will be presented in separate sections of the analysis report. Visualizations, statistical summaries, and insights will be provided to address each question.

# Conclusion
This project aims to deliver data-driven insights into the Seattle Airbnb market, addressing various aspects of property availability, pricing, and guest satisfaction. The analysis results will contribute to a better understanding of the rental market in the city.
